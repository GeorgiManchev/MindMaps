# Object Oriented Programming Principles
The purpose of a software program is to solve some real world problem. The idea behaind a `Class` is to resemble real world object classes aka `My name is George an I am a person` = George is an instance of a Class Person. </br>In code : Person george = New Person();</br>

# Inheritance
`Goal = Reuse code`
Rules: Adding complexity intoducing Interfaces is prefered than chain inheritance.

# Polymorhism
`Goal = Loose Coupling`
Rules: Use when it makes sense.

# Encapsulation
`Goal = Security, Extension`


Rules: Always use `public` property methods to access `private` fields

# Abstraction - The real sh*t
`Goal = Loose Coupling`
What is crappy writen code?
Why people write Crappy code?

Rules:Code against some type of Abstraction (Abstract class, Interface) awlays when your code depends on some class otside of the language base library. Skip rule on DataObjectClasses (classes holding only data aka no logic)
